Be sure to watch the Introduction module to see how to run these course demos.  On a Mac, you may need to specify sudo before each command depending on how your permissions are set up.

You need to install node with npm, and execute (in each before/after folder): npm update

This will read package.json and install the needed packages.

Then execute: npm run dev

That will start up the development web server and browser sync.
