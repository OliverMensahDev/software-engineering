/**
 * Question 3:
 * Write a program that simulates rolling a pair of dice. 
 * Roll of 1st die will give a number between 1 and 6. 
 * Roll of 2nd die will also give a number between 1 and 6. You can use java.security.SecureRandom class 
 * to get the numbers for both the dice. Their sum can be number between 2 and 12. 
 * 
 * At the start ask the user to guess a number between 2 and 12. Then roll both the dice and if their 
 * sum matches with the guessed number then we have a winner. Display greetings and exit the program. 
 * 
 * But if their sum doesnâ€™t match, then ask user, if he would like to play again. 
 * If his answer is n, then exit the program but if his answer is y then re-run the same logic.
