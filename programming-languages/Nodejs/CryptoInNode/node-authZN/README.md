# node-authZN
Demonstrating a solution for complete mediation in a Node.js application.

Watch me build this application in my blog post on [Securing your Node API](https://greenmachinesec.wordpress.com/2017/06/07/secure-your-api-in-node-js/ "Secure Your API in Node.js").

This application uses JSON Web Tokens for authentication and implements custom authorization for data.

It is a simple banking REST API that allows a user to perform transfers, deposits, withdraws, and balance inquiries.

Use it as a starting point for investigating different authorization models for your API and see which one fits your application!
